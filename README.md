# AMRCC
Frame_James_SP21 is the report for this application which lays out the looks and operation of it. The report also contains a link to a demonstration video. There was an issue with the digital signatures of two signees disappearing on upload. A screenshot has been uploaded along side the pdf to show that all the signatures were there.


This was developed in Qt Creator 4.12.4



In order for full functionality to be there and not have issues the distance.py and RCCBot.py MUST be manually copied to the build folder.
