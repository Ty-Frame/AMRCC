# AMRCC
THIS PROJECT IS NOT DONE UNTIL THE REPORT HAS BEEN UPLOADED TO THIS GIT.
The report describes how the application looks visually and how it operates.
There is also a link to the demo video on the report.

This was developed in Qt Creator 4.12.4



In order for full functionality to be there and not have issues the distance.py and RCCBot.py MUST be manually copied to the build folder.
